Quick Jenkins Setup
===================

Before upgrade:

    - update plugins
    - backup settings with thinBackup (backup location is outside of Jenkins home)

After upgrade:
    - initialize a fresh Jenkins home (NB: secrets are now reset);
    - install thinBackup plugin, configure it to the baclup location;
    - restore backup, including restore plugins; wait until plugins are restored;
    - service jenkins restart, wait until plugins are initialized;
    - reset admin password with echo -n admin:admin | sha256 ...;
    - update (re-new) credentials (jenkins: SSH key id_rsa-jenkins-test);
    - check node liveness;


Manual Jenkins Setup
====================

Plugins:

    - SSH
    - SSH Slaves
    - Git
    - Pipeline
    - SSH Agent
    - Node And Label Parameter
    - Configuration as Code Support ? (not needed)
    - Workspace Cleanup
    - ThinBackup


Credentials:
    SSH Private key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa-jenkins-test

Nodes:
    name: vm-101
    executors: 16
    remote root: /home/jenkins
    labels: freebsd/archlinus/centos
    usage: only build jobs with label expressions matching this node
    launch method: agent via ssh
    host: vm-101
    credentials: jenkins
    host key verification strategy: not verifying
    availability: keep as much as possible

Nodes/Node Monitoring:
    Preventive Node monitoring:
        Clock Difference: off
        Free Temp Space/Free Space Threshold: 128MB


Jobs:

    Free Style Project
        name: mndev-platform
        Discard old builds
        Project is parameterized:
            - LabelParameterValue mylabel
            - string setupenv
            - string module

        Execute concurrent builds if necessary

    Source Code Management:
        Git:
            url: mkushnir@big-1:development/mnci
            credentials: jenkins

    Build Environment:
        SSH Agent:
            Credentials: jenkins

    Build:
        Execute Shell:

export HOME=$WORKSPACE/stage
mkdir -p $HOME
PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH

export BUILDROOT=$WORKSPACE/qwe
mkdir -p $BUILDROOT

./setup-env init

make ${module}-${setupenv}


    Pipeline
        name: mndev
        Discard old builds
        Project is parameterized:
